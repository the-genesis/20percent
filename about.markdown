There's no reason why man shouldn't be able to walk to the moon. Look at the stairs!!
But we have become complacent in our own inability and it has become the norm. Time and
time again, age over age, I have found this to be the fundamental flaw of humanity: their
ability to replace the permanence of their reality with the non-permanence of the current
status quo. My race would come and this feeble, weakling race would be naught more than an
afterthought. 

Unless, of course, if the inner strenght of the human spirit they yammer on 
about decides to show up!

Then, they'll be a little more than a memory.
